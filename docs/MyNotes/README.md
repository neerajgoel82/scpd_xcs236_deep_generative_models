### Introduction 
---
This section will contain my notes of the course [XCS236](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs236-deep-generative-models) - Deep Generative Models. I would be including some information I got from reading the [text book from OReilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174) as well. That book is on the same subject. So here I go ...

### What is Generative Modelling 
---
Â 
Generative modeling is a branch of machine learning that involves training a model to produce new data that is similar to a given dataset.

### Some Use Cases 
---

##### Image Generation & Control
Generative models can create realistic images based on rough sketches or other control signals.
These models help users who may not be skilled artists to generate high-quality visual content.

##### Audio Applications
Similar techniques apply to generative models for audio, where input signals can shape the generated sound.
Examples include voice synthesis and music composition.

##### Enhancements & Applications
Generative models are used in tasks like style transfer, content creation, and data augmentation.
They enable creative control, allowing for transformation of inputs into complex, high-quality outputs.

### High Level View - What do we do in the modelling process?
---
- We have a dataset of observations 
- We assume that the observations have been generated according to some unknown distribution, *p<sub>data</sub>*
- We want to build a generative model *p<sub>theta</sub>*
 that mimics *p<sub>data</sub>*
- If we achieve this goal, we can sample from 
 to generate observations that appear to have been drawn from *p<sub>data</sub>*


### Generative Versus Discriminative Modeling
---
Discriminative modeling estimates *p(y|x)* i.e. discriminative modeling aims to model the probability of a label given some observation. Generative modeling estimates *p(x)* i.e.generative modeling aims to model the probability of observing an observation. Sampling from this distribution allows us to generate new observations.
