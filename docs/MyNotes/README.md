### Introduction 
This section will contain my notes of the course [XCS236](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs236-deep-generative-models) - Deep Generative Models. I would be including some information I got from reading the [text book from OReilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174) as well. That book is on the same subject.
